1. Explain about the different complex data types in pig
              Pig has four complex datatypes: Map,Tuples,Atom and Bag.All these datatypes can contain data of any type including other complex datatypes.
              MAP:
                  *A map is a set of key-value pairs. 
                  *The key is of type chararray and should be unique.
                  *The value might be of any type. It is represented by ‘[]’
                  Eg:[id#25,age#45]
                  
              BAG:
                  *A bag is an unordered collection of tuples. 
                  *A bag can have duplicate tuples.
                  *The tuples inside the bag are enclosed in brackets separated by comma(,).
                  *A bag can have tuples with differing numbers of fields. However, if Pig tries to access a field that does not exist,
                   a null value is substituted.
                  Eg:{('nish', 22), ('adhi', 22), ('johny', 25)} 
                  
              TUPLE:
                  *A tuple is a fixed-length, ordered collection of Pig data elements. 
                  *Tuples are divided into fields and each field containing one element of any data type.
                  Eg:(vignesh,23)
                  
              ATOM:
                  *Any single value in Pig Latin, irrespective of their data or type is known as an Atom. 
                  *It is stored as bytearray by default and can be used as string or number like int, long,
                   float, double, chararray, and bytearray are the atomic values of Pig. 
                  Eg:'name' or '25' 
                  
2.How can you interact with the shell in Apache pig?
       Interaction with pig shell can be done in two ways:
       Using Grunt shell and using script files
       GRUNT SHELL:
              *Interactive Shell for executing Pig Commands.
              *Used when script file is not provided.
              *Can execute scripts from Grunt via run or exec commands.
       SCRIPT FILES:
              *Executes Commands in a file
              *pig ScriptFile.pig
              *Pig commands are executed using script files as batch Jobs.
              
3.Explain how pig differs from Map reduce?
         *Pig is a high level language whereas MapReduce is a low level language.
         *Performing a join operation is easy in Pig compared to MapReduce.
         *Pig is a dataflow language whereas MapReduce is a data processing paradigm.
         *Basic knowledge in sql is enough to work with Pig.But to work with Mapreduce,one has to know java programming.
         *Number of code lines is less in Pig compared to MapReduce.
         *Pig is a scripting language and MapReduce is a compiled language.
         *Abstraction level is high in Pig compared to Mapreduce
